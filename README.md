# React JS + Docker

I made this repository to practice using Docker in a React js application.

To use the React JS project with Docker you must follow these steps:

- Download or Clone the project
- In the root folder of the project, run the commando: `docker-compose up`
- Open Open [http://localhost:3000] to see the app running


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
